## Title: Image of the City: An Alternative to Global Positioning System

### Aim: Testing a method of geolocation through the image of a city

### Background:
The research builds from the capstone project in development within the Design in Action, Colloquium III, part of the MS Computational Design Practices Program. Colocate (capstone project title) is a peer-to-peer privacy forward wayfinding system. Developing Colocate as a product requires understanding competitive advantages and testing existing consumer wayfinding systems. Google Maps, a prominent wayfinding application, has developed a new method of geolocating users through augmented reality and understanding a device's location through imaging. The algorithm bases its foundational idealogy on the permanence of the city's image, similar to the ideas presented in the book “Image of the City” by Kevin Lynch. Google's proposed technology fundamentally focuses on understanding edges, nodes, and landmarks. Coined Visual Positioning System (VPS) may provide a way to test the notion of permanence and understand how we navigate the built environment today through computation. 

### Methodology:
Through the process of design thinking, the research intends to build and prototype with the VPS (Geospatial) API to create an interactive augmented reality method to collect and image these images of the city. Using the design thinking process in 6 phases over the course of an intense six weeks of exercise:
Week 1:    > Conduct user research studies
Week 2:    > Defining the user problem and current experience 
Week 3:    > Ideate on the interaction between the users and the application
Week 4:    > Build the prototype and test the interface with users
Week 5:    > Iterate on the feedback from the users
Week 6:    > Findings culminating the prototype with a website

### Deliverables:
Prototype - User Application
Website of the prototype, process, and findings documentation
